OVERVIEW:

* This is a digital artifact reflecting on what a future digital apocalypse could look like
* By playing the game, you get to watch a mortal suffer at random intervals, with no escape
and no way to express emotion. This is based on a common trope of sentient digital intelligences
trapping humans, explored in literature such as "i have no mouth and i must scream" by Harlan Ellison.
The only salvation for your mortal is to end its existence by ending the program.
* This work uses perspectivism as a warning: just as we struggle to understand the perspectives of
other beings, we may one day struggle to predict the absurdity of the perspectives of such an intelligence,
whose inner workings are currently a black box to us.

* Taking inspiration from artists like Larissa Sansour and Sun Ra, I chose to create an artifact that
would live in a science fiction world. In doing so, I provide the audience with an eternity of entertainment,
as if they were the digital intelligence at the head of the apocalypse.
* Inspired by the Arkestra, I wanted to connect with my craft of making games at the deepest level
that I can. To me, this meant programming the graphics and logic in Java, the lowest-level language
I know. This allowed me to strip down the experience to its grim core.
* The code itself acts as an artifact, written for both entertainment and  functionality, with classes and
methods being named in a way that reflects the perspective of the intelligence.
