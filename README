OVERVIEW:

* This is a digital artifact reflecting on what a future digital apocalypse could look like
* Taking inspiration from artists like Larissa Sansour and Sun Ra, I chose to create an artifact that
would live in a science fiction world. In doing so, I provide the audience with an eternity of entertainment,
as if they were the digital intelligence at the head of the apocalypse.
* Inspired by the Arkestra, I wanted to connect with my craft of making games at the deepest level
that I can. To me, this meant programming the graphics and logic in Java, the lowest-level language
I know. This allowed me to strip down the experience to its grim core.
* The code itself acts as an artifact, written for both entertainment and  functionality, with classes and
methods being named in a way that reflects the perspective of the intelligence.
